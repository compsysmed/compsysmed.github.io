### PhD Student position (65% E13, 3 years) available immediately

Diseases are currently defined and diagnosed based on symptoms (e.g.,
hypertension, depression) or affected organs (e.g., heart failure,
nephropathy). Clearly, there is a lack of mechanistic understanding of diseases
that could improve disease definitions and allow for more informed selection
and development of therapies. To achieve such understanding we develop
integrative bioinformatics methods leveraging network analysis, machine
learning techniques, and statistical approaches. Your work will focus on the
development of graph-based machine learning techniques to identify disease- and
patient-specific dysregulated subnetworks.
