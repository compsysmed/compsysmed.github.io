 abstract = {OMICs subsume different physiological layers including the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Recent advances in analytical techniques allow for the exhaustive determination of biomolecules in all OMICs levels from less invasive human specimens such as blood and urine. Investigating OMICs in deeply characterized population-based or experimental studies has led to seminal improvement of our understanding of genetic determinants of thyroid function, identified putative thyroid hormone target genes and thyroid hormone-induced shifts in the plasma protein and metabolite content. Consequently, plasma biomolecules have been suggested as surrogates of tissue-specific action of thyroid hormones. This review provides a brief introduction to OMICs in thyroid research with a particular focus on metabolomics studies in humans elucidating the important role of thyroid hormones for whole body metabolism in adults.},
