I'm a research group leader at the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics.
My group works on network biology, multi omics integration and machine learning
in the context of systems medicine. In my graduate studies at the University of
Greifswald in Germany, I analysed different omics data in the context of common
diseases. Before I joined the Interfaculty Institute of Functional Genomics at
the University Medicine Greifswald, I studied bioinformatics in Saarbrücken,
focussing on network biology. During my studies I spent some time abroad at the
University of Iceland. I was awarded a Honor's Degree in Bioinformatics from
the Saarland University and the Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics.

I am a PhD student in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TU Munich. I
received my Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir
University of Technology (Tehran, Iran) and my Master’s degree in
Bioinformatics from Saarland University (Saarbrücken, Germany). In my master
thesis I analyzed disease-specific gene regulatory networks in terms of
co-regulatory network motifs. My research interests include multi-omics data
and network biology. I am currently involved in REPO-TRIAL, a H2020 funded drug
repurposing project. _sadegh@wzw.tum.de_

I’m a PhD student in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics in collaboration
with the Institute of Pathology, both at TUM. I’ve originally joined Prof.
Baumbach’s lab to work on my master’s thesis in bioinformatics, focused to
identify pathway-based subnetwork of genes most significantly associated to
survival time of cancer patients. Other topics of my interest are machine
learning (both supervised and unsupervised), manipulation and analysis of the
data from a statistical point of view. _lautizi@wzw.tum.de_

### Lorenzo Viola

I'm a master student in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University,
Rome. My curriculum is focused on data mining and management, also on a large
scale. A bioinformatics course has inspired me to join the Chair of
Experimental Bioinformatics for developing my thesis project, dealing with
multimodal network-based epistasis detection on a genome-wide scale.

I'm a bachelor student in Bioinformatics at TUM and LMU in Munich and recently
joined the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics in Weihenstephan for my
bachelor thesis on the harmonisation of GWAS data for machine learning
purposes.

I study bioinformatics since Oct‘2018 in Munich with a research interest in
human genetics and cancer biology. Before that I received a master’s degree in
biology at the LMU Munich. During my studies, I focused on molecular and cell
biology and protein biochemistry. I recently joined the Chair of Experimental
Bioinformatics as a Hiwi to work on the diseasome project for a better
understanding of a disease-gene interactions.

I’m a Bioinformatics Bachelor student at the Technical University of Munich and
the LMU since October 2016. I recently joined the Chair of Experimental
Bioinformatics at TUM as a HiWi to gain more practical experience in
bioinformatics.
